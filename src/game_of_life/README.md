# Game of Life

Write some code that evolves generations through the "game of life".

The input will be a game board of cells, either alive (1) or dead (0).

The code should take this board and create a new board for the next generation based on the following rules:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies (under-population)
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation (survival)
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies (overcrowding)
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell (reproduction)

As an example, this game board as input:
```
0 1 0 0 0
1 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 1
0 1 0 0 0
1 0 0 0 1
```

Will have a subsequent generation of:
```
0 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

Figure out how to display an N x N grid in the browser that takes up all
available space, handles browser resizing, and displays the current state of
the game.

### How to run in the browser

```
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```

Changes should be picked up by the HMR & automatically be loaded into the page. Sometimes a full refresh is necessary.
